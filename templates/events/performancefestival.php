<a href="https://www.max-grau.de">Max Grau</a> (*1988) is a visual artist and writer based in Berlin. He studied Fine Arts in Saarbrücken, Berlin and Los Angeles and uses a variety of media such as video, text, email, performance, photography, sound and printed matter. Besides doing things individually he’s interested in friendship-based models of collaboration and forms a part-time duo with Jan Erbelding. Since 2016 he has been involved in *foundationClass – an educational project located at Kunsthochschule Weißensee that tries to support artists who had to flee their home countries in the process of gaining access to the German art school system. His work has been shown internationally, for example at Galerie La Croix Los Angeles, Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg, Galerie Lily Robert Paris, Pet Projects Perth and Digital Art Centre Taipei. His first book ›You See I’ve Always Wanted Things To Be Beautiful‹ was published in 2018 by Ruine München/Hamman van Mier Verlag.

	                Cyborgs and body enhancement are typically male dominated topics (Terminator etc.). In the contrary the female connoted beauty industry is also highly technologically developed. Body and technology are already closely interconnected. Bringing together these topics in FUN. Do computers have a crush on pink? (DE)

<br><strong>Workshop:</strong> <em>#HotPhones - high-tech self-care</em><br>
	In this workshop you learn how to get your phone hotter than you, because a #hotphone helps to release and relax your tightened muscles. The #hotphone massage is a relaxing and deeply soothing form of massage. It's a helpful tool you can easily integrate in your daily life. It makes you fit again and activates new energy for you and your smartphone. (EN)</p>

<p><br><a href="http://nadjabuttendorf.com/"><strong>Nadja Buttendorf</strong></a>  presents her current work:<br><em> "The Adventures of WH - Kapitel 1: Diskriminator"</em>, which deals with socialist microchip design, archive handling and personal competition within the post gender micro electronic universe. In collaboration with Anne Baumann, they look at Buttendorf's step grandfather and physicists Werner Hartmann (1912-1988), who is known to be the founder of microelectronics in GDR.</p>

                <p><br> <a href="http://houseofkilling.net/"><strong>Esben Holk</strong></a><br>HOUSE OF KILLING and how to absorb the ontological uncertainty of Jennifer Aniston
come with anarchist art collective and co-creator of Jennifer Aniston Superfans: HOUSE OF KILLING on a philosophical inquiry on what Jennifer Aniston and other referential data can bring to the production of the posthuman experience, and consequently: the increasingly irrelevant art of Esben Holk. <br>
HOUSE OF KILLING is a house that kills. It is an undefined flexible anarchist queer collective, put into this world to kill ideas, structures, dreams and realities, in order to promote a generation of undefined flexible queer youth able and willing to do whatever the fuck they want.<br>
HOUSE OF KILLING feat Esben Holk is an avid online entity: a posthuman queer artist working in browserbased experiences, performative strategies and creative coding. Concerned with the absence of ontological density and anti-essentialist epistemology in current ideology, he approaches the agility of proposed productions of enforced entities, like: the queer, the citizen and the worker. Vehemently xenofeminist and anti naturalist, the artist manifests work as part of a grand online performance celebrating the internet, and its ability to subvert and overthrow the established world order.<br><br>
​Didnt I tell u, I was lost? infinitely shared and used in corners of virtual spaces I dont know about, in crevices not even the dankest of users would dare go into. Unsurprisingly, the work left me behind: now its clickbait on my website.<br><br>
