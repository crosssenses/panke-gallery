                     <p><strong><a href="http://www.sebastianschmieg.com">Sebastian Schmieg</a> </strong>examines the ways networked technologies shape online
and offline realities, in artworks that range from shredded hard-drives
from a Google datacenter to crowd-sourced versions of popular self-help
books using Amazon's Kindle. His output encompasses websites, interface
performances, algorithmic videos, online interventions, print-on-demand
books or neural networks. He focuses on a critical engagement with the
manifold and ubiquitous nodes of the Internet – both human and
technological – as sites of the political. Previously his work has been
exhibited at Transmediale, Berlin, Germany; Art Center Nabi, Seoul,
South Korea; Bitforms Gallery, New York, USA; and The Photographers’
Gallery, London, UK. Sebastian Schmieg lives and works in Berlin.</p>
