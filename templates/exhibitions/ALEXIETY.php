                    <p>ALEXIETY is panke.gallery Edition #002. Together with French musician
Low Jack, !Mediengruppe Bitnik have been looking at ways to engage with
Alexa and similar <s>Intelligent</s> Personal Assistants through music. A set
of three songs attempt to capture the feelings we develop toward
<s>Intelligent</s> Personal Assistants: The carefree love that embraces Alexa
before the data privacy and surveillance issues outweigh the benefits.
The alienation and decoupling from the allure of remote control and
instant gratification. The anxiety and discomfort around Alexa and other
<s>Intelligent</s> Personal Assistants that is Alexiety.
<br><br>

<s>Intelligent</s> Personal Assistants like Alexa, Google Home and Siri are the
brains of the <s>smart</s> home ecosystem. They operate, monitor and control
<s>smart</s> home appliances while keeping the algorithms and rule-sets that
determine their workings secret. <s>Intelligent</s> Personal Devices are voice
controlled, thus dissolving the machinic presence of the computer while
placing its functionalities at the users disposal. It's like living
inside the machine, while at the same time having no agency over the
composition and structure of ones environment.
<br><br>

What are the relationships that we are forming with these IPA devices?
What happens when IoT devices are hacked to form rogue bot-networks? Is
my capacity to act expanded or diminished when relying on these
semi-autonomous devices?

birth of <em>RaveEnabler</em> <a href="https://0b673cce.xyz">https://0b673cce.xyz/</a> - mining Monero (XMR) in
support of local Cryptorave networks by donating CPU power.

                    <p><strong><a href="http://www.punkisdada.com/">Omsk Social Club</a></strong> Lives and works in Berlin. She has exhibited across Europe in various institutions, galleries and offsites such as Migros Museum für Gegenwartskunst, Zürich, Middlesbrough Modern Institute of Art, Bergen Kunsthalle, Gold and Beton Cologne, “Vomit Apocalypse” for Glasgow International and Kunsthalle Zürich. She attended The Eternal Internet Brother/Sisterhood residency in Sri Lanka in 2016 curated by Angelo Plessas and was awarded the Gleis 70 Zurich international artist award from Pro Helvetia in 2017 and the 8th ARTWARD Junior Prize in Munich. <br>
 <br>
Her theoretical essays and creative texts have been commissioned for Kaleidoscope Magazine, NXS, Badlands, A little disaster, NRW Forum Düsseldorf Status Effect curated by Andrew Varano, Websafe2k16, Oncurating.org  - “Alienation and Estrangement Issue” edited by Dorothee Richter. She was also recently included in the book Polar Reflex for the exhibition “The Internet is Present” edited by Reese Riley. <br>
<br>
Omsk Social Club coined and works heavily with the concept of Cosmic Depression – The theory of depression caused by digital utopia (Paradise without Ecology) and Real Game Play. Omsk’s practice spans from visual to theoretical production often using the model of gaming. Working with a cross disciplinary practice and over many avatars or pseudo-names. Omsk Social Club is constantly observing and questioning the concept of Self, Individualism and the community both in off and online scenarios. Pioneering the spectacle Ying Colosseum in Berlin (2015-2016) and Play Co Summit with Ed Fornieles (2017-ongoing), She is heavily influenced by her peers and their voices as collective anonymous mass often incorporating them into her Meta Larps and Real Games. One may liken her output to a new form of relational aesthetic practice.<br>

 <p><strong><a href="https://wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.bitnik.org">!MEDIENGRUPPE BITNIK</a></strong> (read - the not Mediengruppe Bitnik) are contemporary artists working on, and with, the Internet. Their practice expands from the digital to physical spaces, often intentionally applying loss of control to challenge established structures and mechanisms. In the past they have been known to subvert surveillance cameras, bug an opera house to broadcast its performances outside, send a parcel containing a camera to Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and physically glitch a building. In 2014, they sent a bot called «Random Darknet Shopper» on a three-month shopping spree in the Darknets where it randomly bought items like keys, cigarettes, trainers and Ecstasy and had them sent directly to the gallery space. !Mediengruppe Bitnik’s works formulate fundamental questions concerning contemporary issues. <br>
 <br>
Their works are shown internationally, most recently in exhibitions at Annka Kultys Gallery London, House of Electronic Arts Basel, Eigen + Art Lab Berlin, Super Dakota Brussels, Centre Culturel Suisse Paris, Aksioma Ljubljana, Kunsthaus Zurich, FACT Liverpool, Onassis Cultural Center Athens, Public Access Gallery Chicago, Kunstverein Hannover, Nam June Paik Art Center South Korea, Fondazione Prada Milano, Shanghai Minsheng 21st Century Museum, The Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts Moscow, Cabaret Voltaire Zurich, Beijing Contemporary Art Biennial and the Tehran Roaming Biennial.
