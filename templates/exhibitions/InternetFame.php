				<p><strong><a href="http://designingdance.org">Carol Breen</a></strong> through various mediums to examine how the processes of remaking, re-recording and re-choreographing, can reveal tensions between temporal regimes. Her work explores the impact entangled technologies have on how practice is defined and categorized and she is interested in the politics between digital and physical spaces and places.

				<p><strong><a href="https://www.houseofkilling.net">Esben Holk</a></strong>HOUSE OF KILLING feat Esben Holk is a BFA graduate from the Bergen Academy of Art and Design 2017, with a background in creative coding, browserbased experiences and performative strategies. Concerned with the absence of ontological density in the material and notional existence of produced entities, such as the queer, he has been researching the agility of the proposed borders that define such objects. Vehemently anti-essentialist and anti-naturalist, the posthuman artist proactively approaches the sensation of being a lost entity as a weapon in a revolution. Almost like a selfcomforting mechanism, the works are desperate attempts to find meaning and reason with the constant displacement from certainty: an unsubstantiated self, in selfharming ways, trying to find substance.</p>
				<p><strong><a href="http://chatonsky.net/">Gregory Chatonsky</a></strong> Born in 1971 in Paris, France. Lives and works in Paris and Montreal.
For Grégory Chatonsky, technologies, and in particular the Internet, constitute an important source of reflection. Forming the paradoxes of the network and the discrepancies between its technological and existential dimensions could summarize a research that is deployed on several mediums: installation, video, photography, writing, drawing and sculpture. His works could evoke infinite spaces in which the fragmentation of attention reigns. The network becomes a world where the boundaries between technology and the human being become blurred. His practice tries to draw the outlines of a new imaginary whose invention would be technical.</p>
