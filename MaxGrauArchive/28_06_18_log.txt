Und die tolle Einladung. Als altes Pollesch-Fangirl ist Gießen natürlc[BACKSP] ich aufregend.[ENTER] [ENTER] Jetzt ist es leider wirklich sehr kurzfristig. Ich bin bis zum 13. Juli bei einer Residency in Frankreich. Komme am 13. also erst in Berlin wieder an. Am 14. hab ich einen Termin in Berlin, der  [alt][LEFT]   [alt][LEFT]   [alt][LEFT]   [alt][LEFT]   [alt][LEFT]   [alt][LEFT]   [alt][LEFT]   [alt][LEFT]   [alt][LEFT]   [alt][LEFT]   [alt][LEFT]   [alt][LEFT]   [alt][LEFT]   [alt][LEFT]   [alt][LEFT]   [alt][LEFT]   [alt][LEFT]   [alt][LEFT]   [alt][LEFT]   [alt][RIGHT]   [alt][RIGHT]   [alt][LEFT]   [alt][shift][RIGHT]   [alt][shift][RIGHT]   [alt][shift][RIGHT]   [alt][shift][RIGHT]   [alt][shift][RIGHT]   [alt][shift][RIGHT]   [alt][shift][RIGHT]   [alt][shift][RIGHT]   [alt][shift][RIGHT]   [alt][shift][RIGHT]   [alt][shift][LEFT]  [BACKSP]  [cmd][RIGHT]  sich nicht verschieben lässt.

[ENTER] [ENTER] Diese Arbeit die da s [alt][shift][LEFT]   [alt][shift][LEFT]  ich da im Ramen des Performing Art Festivals vorgestellt hatte, ist ja so eine Art Langzeit Online Performance die via Livee [BACKSP] [BACKSP]  Stream kontinuierlich statt d[BACKSP] feinde[BACKSP] [BACKSP] [BACKSP] [BACKSP] [BACKSP] indet. Grundsätzlich eigentlich eine schöne über[BACKSP] [BACKSP] [BACKSP] [BACKSP]  [alt][shift][LEFT]   [alt][shift][LEFT]  [RIGHT]  [alt][shift][LEFT]  ganz snnige[BACKSP] [BACKSP] [BACKSP] [BACKSP] [BACKSP] i [alt][shift][LEFT]  lustig Überschneidung zum [BACKSP] [BACKSP] r Abwesenheit.

Um am 13. tatsächlich  [alt][shift][LEFT]   [alt][shift][LEFT]   [alt][shift][LEFT]   [alt][shift][LEFT]  Am 13. einfach zu streamen fällt wollt eher aus, da ich im Flugzeug sitze.

Jeweils wohl eher keine Verlässlich [alt][LEFT]  [shift][RIGHT] v [cmd][RIGHT]  e Internet Verbindung.  [BACKSP] Ich denke auch, dass ein 1-zu-1 aufführen dieser [BACKSP] [BACKSP] [BACKSP] [BACKSP] [BACKSP] [BACKSP] [BACKSP] des Online Streams für ein Festival Publikum eher unbefriedigend sein könnte. Das sind meistens ganze Tag [BACKSP] e [alt][shift][LEFT]   [alt][shift][LEFT]   [alt][shift][LEFT]   [alt][shift][RIGHT]   [alt][shift][RIGHT]   [alt][shift][LEFT]  mehrer Stunden die ich dort  [cmd]w streame, ich glaube für ZuschauerÜ[BACKSP] *innen funktioniert das am besten we[BACKSP] [BACKSP] [BACKSP] , wenn da relativ unverbindlich rein und raus gel[BACKSP] klickt werden kann.
