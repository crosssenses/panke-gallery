I don [alt]' t know. I don [alt]' t fucking know.[BACKSP] I like well produced stuff. I like people willing to go all the way. Look, Oliver Laric might not be the worst.

I struggle to find any  [alt]N understanding [alt]B  in the endless variations of reiterated classic sculptures Laric is putting up all over museums  [alt][LEFT]  mid-level  [cmd][RIGHT]  in Europe and the US.
